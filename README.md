Search-Images an app built in React Native that allows a user to perform an image search. 
The app allows the user to input a text query and display all the images for that query in a scrollable list. 
Clicking on an image should bring the user to a detail page which displays that image along with some additional information.

### Technology Stack
We tried to use a completely modern tech stack while testing out some new technologies that we had never used before. This resulted in a fast, performant, and easily-extensible web app that should be fairly future-proof for the coming next several years.
